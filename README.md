# flow-cell
STL and F3D files for a microfluidics flow cell - described in Kuempers at al (link to follow). 

All files are designed to be printed on a Stereolithography 3D printer - we used a FormLabs Form 2. 

Suggested settings are to use the maximum resolution allowed by the resin and printer. We have tested these models on Formlabs black, grey and tough resin. 

Add supports to the top side of the model only, leave the bottom side clear to avoid imperfections affecting cover slip fitment or the flow of liquid.
